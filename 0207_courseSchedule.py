# 0207 - Course Schedule

'''
    Question:
        There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 
        You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
        For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
        Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
